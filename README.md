Introduction
The goal of this mini-project is to build a machine-learning system that can predict the title of a song from a 10-second humming or whistling recording. The recordings come from the MLEnd Hums and Whistles II dataset, which contains multiple participants interpreting eight well-known songs by either humming or whistling.

This problem is interesting because:

the audio is short and often noisy,
different participants hum or whistle with very different pitch, tempo and recording conditions,
and the same song can be interpreted in subtly different melodic ways.
The aim is not to reach state-of-the-art accuracy, but to design a sensible end-to-end pipeline, justify the modelling choices, and critically reflect on limitations and possible improvements.
